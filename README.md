# NeighborhoodMapProject
As part of Udacity' Full Stack Nano Degree project, students were asked to create a neighborhood map project, which will include different apis.
In this project, I have included a list of a couple restaurants on the upper west side of Manhattan. Also, I used google maps api & knockout. I have used markers on the map, so that when users are searching on the map, the location will be displayed.
Users can filter down the names of the restaurants.
I have also included the Adresses of the restaurants.

Here is the instructions on how to use this project:
1. Click the following link: https://github.com/vuvu10/NeighborhoodMapProject/
2. Click on the search bar on the upper left side of the page.
3. Type in the name of the restaurants.
